# Oceanside Community Club

The Oceanside Community Club is the non-profit neighborhood organization which owns and manages the Oceanside Community Club Rental Hall. (Sometimes referred to as the Oceanside Community Center.)

The Oceanside Community Club was incorporated in 1949, became a non-profit organization in 1954, and has been in constant use ever since.

It is the community’s only public hall and is the main center for meetings and gatherings. The Community Club holds its monthly meetings there. These meetings generally feature a speaker or presentation about public interest, safety, or educational information.

The Oceanside Community Club, in conjunction with the Netarts Community Club, sponsors the Vera Snow-Reid Scholarship at the TBCC. In recent years the Community Club has donated to support local charities and organizations including the Food Bank, Tillamook High School Choir, and the Tillamook Farmer’s Market.

## Design TODO

Navigation:
- Rental Information - renting
  - can we somehow get Pricing/availability; Rules/Policies; FAQ; as sub-parts of this? Or just have main Rental Info page with the price and availability, then have non-Nav pages of FAQ and Rules?
- Features - features
- News - blog

Consider paginating a collection of 'feature' articles. These can just be single photos or multi-photo things like "the kitchen". Then have that collection shown as cards linking to full pages on a Features Page. Or just use JSON data?
    - mostly working, but need a few things:
    - get small image in card
    - add a back arrow and "Features"? 
    - use pagination on the individual feature pages (just fwd/back)
