The Oceanside Community Club’s location, scenic views, and affordable rates make using the building a great choice for your event.

Open as a rental year-round, the Oceanside Community Club’s rental hall will make your next event a memorable one! 

If the weather’s not cooperating, your event can be held indoors, but you’ll still be able to enjoy the great views.

If the weather is fine then enjoy the coastal air on the patio with terrific views that only Oceanside offers!
